# Modding Environment Setup

1. Download Adoptium.

| Operating System | Download Link |
| :--------------: | :------------ |
| Windows          | <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=windows&arch=x64> Use the `.msi` installer. |
| macOS (M1 or M2) | <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=mac&arch=aarch64> Use the `.pkg` installer. |
| macOS (Intel)    | <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=mac&arch=x64> Use the `.pkg` installer. |
| Linux            | Use your system package manager to install Java 17 JRE or JDK. Any distribution should work, but I like OpenJDK |

2. Download Prism Launcher from <https://prismlauncher.org>. Make sure you get the installer, not the portable.
3. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. During the setup, select the JRE you installed in step one,
when it prompts you to select a Java version.

You're done! From here, you can use the Add Instance button to either create a new vanilla instance, or you can follow the
[performance](./performance.md) instructions if you want to optimize your game.
